   - Calculates actual outcomes
   - Applies profit targets/stop losses
   - Generates statistics

### CLI Tools

|---------|---------|---------|
| `npm run backfill-historical` | Collect historical data | `--watchlist --years 3` |
| `npm run analyze-historical` | Analyze spreads | `--watchlist --years 2` |
| `npx tsx scripts/quick-stats.ts` | View data statistics | - |
| `npx tsx scripts/verify-historical-data.ts` | Verify data quality | - |
| `npx tsx scripts/monitor-backfill.ts` | Live progress monitor | - |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Collection ✅ (IN PROGRESS - ~10 min)

```bash
npm run backfill-historical -- --watchlist --years 3
```

**What happens**:
1. Fetches full stock history (one API call per symbol)
2. Samples options data (every 5th trading day)
3. Stores in database with proper indexing
4. Tracks progress for resume capability

**Current Progress**: AMD nearly complete, 22 symbols remaining

### Phase 2: Spread Analysis (NEXT - ~30 min)

```bash
npm run analyze-historical -- --watchlist --years 2
```

**What happens**:
1. Loads each historical options snapshot
2. Finds all viable put credit spreads matching your criteria:
   - Delta: 0.08-0.20
   - DTE: 7-45 days
   - Minimum credit: $0.30
   - Spread width: $3-15
3. Calculates what would have happened:
   - Tracks stock price through expiration
   - Applies profit targets (50%)
   - Applies stop losses (200% of credit)
   - Records actual exit date and P&L
4. Stores results with full metrics

**Expected output**:
- 5,000-10,000 analyzed spreads
- Win rates by criteria
- Average returns by pattern
- Exit timing analysis

### Phase 3: RAG Integration (Your Code)

Add historical context to your agent:

```typescript
// Example: Get historical win rate for similar setup
async function getHistoricalContext(symbol: string, delta: number, dte: number) {
  const { data: historicalTrades } = await supabase
    .from('historical_spread_analysis')
    .select('*')
    .eq('symbol', symbol)
    .gte('delta', delta - 0.02)
    .lte('delta', delta + 0.02)
    .gte('dte', dte - 3)
    .lte('dte', dte + 3)
    .not('actual_pl_percent', 'is', null)
    .order('snapshot_date', { ascending: false })
    .limit(50);

  if (!historicalTrades || historicalTrades.length === 0) {
    return null;
  }

  const wins = historicalTrades.filter(t => t.actual_pl_percent >= 0).length;
  const winRate = (wins / historicalTrades.length) * 100;
  const avgReturn = historicalTrades.reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.actual_pl_percent, 0) / historicalTrades.length;
  const avgDaysHeld = historicalTrades.reduce((sum, t) => {
    const entryDate = new Date(t.snapshot_date);
    const exitDate = new Date(t.exit_date);
    return sum + (exitDate.getTime() - entryDate.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
  }, 0) / historicalTrades.length;

  return {
    sampleSize: historicalTrades.length,
    winRate,
    avgReturn,
    avgDaysHeld,
    confidence: historicalTrades.length >= 20 ? 'high' : historicalTrades.length >= 10 ? 'medium' : 'low',
  };
}

// Use in your agent
const context = await getHistoricalContext('AMD', 0.13, 10);
if (context) {
  console.log(`📊 Historical Context (${context.sampleSize} similar trades):`);
  console.log(`   Win Rate: ${context.winRate.toFixed(1)}%`);
  console.log(`   Avg Return: ${context.avgReturn.toFixed(1)}%`);
  console.log(`   Avg Days Held: ${context.avgDaysHeld.toFixed(1)}`);
  console.log(`   Confidence: ${context.confidence}`);
}
```

## Powerful Queries

### Find Your Best Performing Patterns

```sql
-- Best delta ranges by win rate
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN delta BETWEEN 0.08 AND 0.12 THEN '0.08-0.12'
    WHEN delta BETWEEN 0.12 AND 0.15 THEN '0.12-0.15'
    WHEN delta BETWEEN 0.15 AND 0.18 THEN '0.15-0.18'
    WHEN delta BETWEEN 0.18 AND 0.20 THEN '0.18-0.20'
  END AS delta_range,
  COUNT(*) as total_trades,
  AVG(CASE WHEN actual_pl_percent >= 0 THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) * 100 AS win_rate,
  AVG(actual_pl_percent) as avg_return,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (exit_date::timestamp - snapshot_date::timestamp)) / 86400) as avg_days_held
FROM historical_spread_analysis
WHERE actual_pl_percent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY delta_range
ORDER BY win_rate DESC;
```

### Find Symbols with Best Track Record

```sql
-- Top performing symbols
SELECT
  symbol,
  COUNT(*) as total_trades,
  AVG(CASE WHEN actual_pl_percent >= 0 THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) * 100 AS win_rate,
  AVG(actual_pl_percent) as avg_return,
  MAX(actual_pl_percent) as best_trade,
  MIN(actual_pl_percent) as worst_trade
FROM historical_spread_analysis
WHERE actual_pl_percent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY symbol
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 20
ORDER BY win_rate DESC, avg_return DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Analyze IPS Score Effectiveness

```sql
-- Does higher IPS score = better outcomes?
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN ips_score >= 80 THEN '80+'
    WHEN ips_score >= 70 THEN '70-79'
    WHEN ips_score >= 60 THEN '60-69'
    WHEN ips_score >= 50 THEN '50-59'
    ELSE '<50'
  END AS ips_range,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  AVG(CASE WHEN actual_pl_percent >= 0 THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) * 100 AS win_rate,
  AVG(actual_pl_percent) as avg_return
FROM historical_spread_analysis
WHERE actual_pl_percent IS NOT NULL AND ips_score IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY ips_range
ORDER BY ips_range DESC;
```

### Best Entry Timing

```sql
-- Which day of week performs best?
SELECT
  EXTRACT(DOW FROM snapshot_date::timestamp) as day_of_week,
  CASE EXTRACT(DOW FROM snapshot_date::timestamp)
    WHEN 0 THEN 'Sunday'
    WHEN 1 THEN 'Monday'
    WHEN 2 THEN 'Tuesday'
    WHEN 3 THEN 'Wednesday'
    WHEN 4 THEN 'Thursday'
    WHEN 5 THEN 'Friday'
    WHEN 6 THEN 'Saturday'
  END as day_name,
  COUNT(*) as trades,
  AVG(actual_pl_percent) as avg_return,
  AVG(CASE WHEN actual_pl_percent >= 0 THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) * 100 AS win_rate
FROM historical_spread_analysis
WHERE actual_pl_percent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY day_of_week, day_name
ORDER BY avg_return DESC;
```

## What This Enables

### Before Historical Data

Your agent says:
> "This is a good setup based on current IPS score of 75"

### After Historical Data

Your agent says:
> "This setup scores 75 on IPS. Historically, 247 similar trades (delta 0.12-0.14, DTE 7-14, IPS 70+) have:
> - Win rate: 78.5%
> - Average return: 42.3%
> - Average hold time: 6.5 days
> - Profit target (50%): 89% of winners
> - Confidence: HIGH (large sample)"

### Real Examples

**Pattern Recognition**:
```
Agent: "This AMD spread matches your highest-performing historical pattern:
  - Delta 0.13 (optimal range: 0.12-0.15)
  - DTE 10 (optimal range: 7-14)
  - IPS 78 (historical avg for winners: 74)
  - Similar trades: 67% win rate, avg return 38%"
```

**Risk Assessment**:
```
Agent: "Risk analysis based on 45 similar historical setups:
  - Max historical loss: -$187 (2.2% of occurrences)
  - Average loss when stopped: -$142
  - Recovery rate after drawdown: 23%
  - Recommendation: Position size 0.5% of capital"
```

**Timing Optimization**:
```
Agent: "Historical timing analysis:
  - Monday entries: 82% win rate
  - Friday entries: 71% win rate
  - Optimal exit: Day 5-7 (63% hit profit target)
  - Average winning trade closes in 6.3 days"
```

## Maintenance

### Weekly Updates

Keep data current:
```bash
# Add last week's data
npm run backfill-historical -- --watchlist --start-date 2025-10-11 --end-date 2025-10-18
npm run analyze-historical -- --watchlist --start-date 2025-10-11
```

### Monthly Re-analysis

Refresh spread outcomes:
```bash
# Re-analyze to capture closed trades
npm run analyze-historical -- --watchlist --years 1
```

### Incremental Growth

The system automatically handles:
- No duplicate insertions (UPSERT)
- Resume after interruption
- Partial symbol updates
- Rolling time windows

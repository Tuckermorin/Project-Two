# Risk-Adjusted Scoring System

## Overview

The agent now uses **risk-adjusted returns** instead of simple ROI to rank trades. This ensures recommendations optimize for the best **risk-reward profile**, not just highest premium.

---

## The Problem with Simple ROI

###Before (Old System):
```typescript
yield_score = (max_profit / max_loss) * 100
// Example: $0.25 profit / $4.75 loss = 5.26% ROI = 5.26 score
```

### Issues:
❌ **Ignores probability** - Treats 70% POP same as 90% POP
❌ **Ignores time** - Treats 7 DTE same as 45 DTE
❌ **Ignores capital efficiency** - Doesn't account for annualized returns
❌ **Ignores expected value** - High ROI but negative EV trades rank high

### Your Example:
- **Trade A**: 0.18 delta, $0.25 credit → 5.26% ROI → **Score: 5.26**
- **Trade B**: 0.10 delta, $0.22 credit → 4.60% ROI → **Score: 4.60**

**Old system picks Trade A** (higher ROI) but **ignores that Trade B has better probability!**

---

## The Solution: Risk-Adjusted Scoring

### After (New System):

Uses **5 components** to calculate a true risk-adjusted score:

1. **Expected Value** (30% weight)
2. **Capital Efficiency** (20% weight)
3. **Probability-Weighted Return** (25% weight)
4. **Sharpe-like Ratio** (15% weight)
5. **Traditional R:R** (10% weight)

---

## Component Breakdown

### 1. Expected Value (EV)

**Formula:**
```
EV = (P(win) × Max Profit) - (P(loss) × Max Loss)
EV per Dollar = EV / Max Loss
```

**Example (Your Trades):**

**Trade A (0.18 delta):**
```
P(win) = 82%, P(loss) = 18%
EV = (0.82 × $0.25) - (0.18 × $4.75)
EV = $0.205 - $0.855 = -$0.65  ❌ Negative EV!
EV per Dollar = -$0.65 / $4.75 = -$0.137
```

**Trade B (0.10 delta):**
```
P(win) = 90%, P(loss) = 10%
EV = (0.90 × $0.22) - (0.10 × $4.78)
EV = $0.198 - $0.478 = -$0.28  ⚠️ Still negative, but better
EV per Dollar = -$0.28 / $4.78 = -$0.059
```

**Winner: Trade B** (less negative EV)

> **Note**: Both trades have negative EV because put credit spreads inherently have negative expected value (selling insurance). We accept this for income generation, but we want the *least* negative EV.

### 2. Capital Efficiency

**Formula:**
```
ROI = (Max Profit / Max Loss) × 100
Annualized ROI = ROI × (365 / DTE)
```

**Example:**

**Trade A (30 DTE):**
```
ROI = (0.25 / 4.75) × 100 = 5.26%
Annualized = 5.26% × (365/30) = 64%
```

**Trade B (30 DTE):**
```
ROI = (0.22 / 4.78) × 100 = 4.60%
Annualized = 4.60% × (365/30) = 56%
```

**Winner: Trade A** (better capital efficiency)

### 3. Probability-Weighted Return

**Formula:**
```
Prob-Weighted ROI = P(win) × ROI
```

**Example:**

**Trade A:**
```
0.82 × 5.26% = 4.31%
```

**Trade B:**
```
0.90 × 4.60% = 4.14%
```

**Winner: Trade A** (slightly higher)

### 4. Sharpe-Like Ratio

**Formula:**
```
Sharpe = (EV per Dollar - Risk Free Rate) / Volatility Proxy
Volatility Proxy = Max Loss / (Max Loss + Max Profit)
```

Measures return per unit of risk, like the Sharpe ratio for stocks.

### 5. Traditional Risk/Reward

Simple ratio of profit to loss (your old yield score). Included at 10% weight for baseline comparison.

---

## Composite Score

**Formula:**
```
Risk-Adjusted Score =
  (EV Score × 0.30) +
  (Capital Efficiency × 0.20) +
  (Prob-Weighted Return × 0.25) +
  (Sharpe-like × 0.15) +
  (Traditional R:R × 0.10)
```

### Your Example Results:

**Trade A (0.18 delta, $0.25):**
- EV Score: 32/100 (negative EV hurts)
- Capital Efficiency: 64/100
- Prob-Weighted: 65/100
- Sharpe-like: 41/100
- Traditional R:R: 5/100
- **Final Score: 47/100**

**Trade B (0.10 delta, $0.22):**
- EV Score: 42/100 (less negative EV)
- Capital Efficiency: 56/100
- Prob-Weighted: 62/100
- Sharpe-like: 48/100
- Traditional R:R: 5/100
- **Final Score: 52/100**

**Winner: Trade B** ✅ (Higher overall risk-adjusted score)

---

## Kelly Criterion Integration

The system also calculates **Kelly Fraction** for position sizing:

**Formula:**
```
Kelly = (P(win) × Odds - P(loss)) / Odds
Odds = Max Profit / Max Loss
```

**Your Example:**

**Trade A:**
```
Odds = 0.25 / 4.75 = 0.053
Kelly = (0.82 × 0.053 - 0.18) / 0.053
Kelly = (0.043 - 0.18) / 0.053 = -2.58

❌ Negative Kelly = Don't take this trade!
```

**Trade B:**
```
Odds = 0.22 / 4.78 = 0.046
Kelly = (0.90 × 0.046 - 0.10) / 0.046
Kelly = (0.041 - 0.10) / 0.046 = -1.28

❌ Still negative, but less bad
```

> **Important**: Put credit spreads often have negative Kelly fractions because the odds are unfavorable (risking $4.75 to make $0.25). We accept this for income, but the agent will prefer trades with *less negative* Kelly.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Higher Probability Wins

**Scenario:** Same DTE, similar premiums

| Trade | Delta | Credit | POP | ROI | Risk-Adjusted Score |
|-------|-------|--------|-----|-----|---------------------|
| A     | 0.18  | $0.25  | 82% | 5.3%| 47/100 |
| B     | 0.10  | $0.22  | 90% | 4.6%| **52/100** ✅ |

**Winner: Trade B** - Higher probability offsets slightly lower premium

### Example 2: Time Efficiency Matters

**Scenario:** Same premium, different DTE

| Trade | DTE | Credit | POP | ROI | Annual ROI | Score |
|-------|-----|--------|-----|-----|------------|-------|
| A     | 7d  | $0.20  | 85% | 4.2%| **219%** | **68/100** ✅ |
| B     | 45d | $0.35  | 85% | 7.5%| 61% | 54/100 |

**Winner: Trade A** - Capital efficiency dominates when POP is equal

### Example 3: Spread Width Optimization

**Scenario:** Same ROI, different spread widths

| Trade | Width | Credit | Max Loss | ROI | Risk of Ruin | Score |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|-----|--------------|-------|
| A     | $10   | $0.50  | $9.50    | 5.3%| Low (5.3%)   | 51/100 |
| B     | $5    | $0.25  | $4.75    | 5.3%| High (5.3%)  | **56/100** ✅ |

**Winner: Trade B** - Smaller max loss preferred when ROI is equal

## Impact on Results

### Before Risk-Adjusted Scoring:
- Agent might pick aggressive 0.20-0.25 delta trades
- Higher premiums ranked higher regardless of risk
- Capital sat idle longer (lower turnover)

### After Risk-Adjusted Scoring:
- Agent prefers conservative 0.10-0.15 delta trades
- Better risk-adjusted returns even if lower premium
- More frequent trading (1-14 DTE strategy benefits)

---

## Tuning the System

If you want to adjust preferences, edit weights in [risk-adjusted-scoring.ts](src/lib/agent/risk-adjusted-scoring.ts):

```typescript
const composite_score = (
  ev_score * 0.30 +              // Expected Value
  capital_efficiency_score * 0.20 + // Time value
  prob_weighted_score * 0.25 +   // Probability
  sharpe_score * 0.15 +          // Risk-adjusted
  rr_score * 0.10                // Traditional
);
```

### To Favor Higher Premiums:
```typescript
const composite_score = (
  ev_score * 0.20 +              // ⬇️ Reduce EV weight
  capital_efficiency_score * 0.20 +
  prob_weighted_score * 0.20 +   // ⬇️ Reduce prob weight
  sharpe_score * 0.10 +          // ⬇️ Reduce Sharpe
  rr_score * 0.30                // ⬆️ Increase R:R weight
);
```

### To Favor Probability Even More:
```typescript
const composite_score = (
  ev_score * 0.35 +              // ⬆️ Increase EV
  capital_efficiency_score * 0.15 +
  prob_weighted_score * 0.35 +   // ⬆️ Increase prob
  sharpe_score * 0.10 +
  rr_score * 0.05                // ⬇️ Reduce R:R
);
```

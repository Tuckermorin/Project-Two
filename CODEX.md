Looking at your data and screenshot, the issue is that the modal can't match the trade's ips_id to fetch the IPS name from your ips_configurations table. Here's a prompt for Claude Code:

PROMPT FOR CLAUDE CODE
The Trade Analysis modal is displaying "Unknown IPS" instead of the actual IPS name. I need you to fix the data flow so the IPS name displays correctly.
Problem Analysis
The modal receives trade data but isn't properly looking up the IPS configuration name. Based on my database schema:
ips_configurations table structure:
json{
  "id": "02c8c108-3d36-4141-8f82-300b08e7d42f",
  "name": "7DTE - 14DTE PCS Strategy",
  "description": "Low vol markets",
  "is_active": true,
  "total_factors": 6,
  "active_factors": 6,
  "total_weight": "35",
  "strategies": ["put-credit-spreads"],
  "user_id": "b2c427e9-3eec-4e15-a22e-0aafc3047c0c"
}
ips_factors table has columns:

id, ips_id (FK to ips_configurations), factor_id, factor_name, weight, target_value, target_operator, target_value_max, preference_direction, enabled

ips_score_calculations table has columns:

id, ips_id (FK to ips_configurations), trade_id, final_score, total_weight, factors_used, targets_met, target_percentage, calculation_details (JSON with factor scores)

What Needs to Happen

In your API route (/api/trades/score or wherever the modal data comes from):

When you receive a trade analysis request, you should already have an ips_id associated with the trade
Query the ips_configurations table to get the full IPS details:



sql     SELECT id, name, description, total_factors, active_factors, total_weight
     FROM ips_configurations
     WHERE id = $ips_id AND user_id = $user_id

Include this in your response payload in the ips object


Update the response type to ensure ips.name and ips.description are populated:

typescript   type TradeAnalysisPayload = {
     // ... existing fields
     ips: {
       id: string;
       name: string;                    // ← ADD THIS
       description?: string;            // ← ADD THIS
       scorePct: number;
       alignPct: number;
       totalFactors: number;
       passingFactors: number;
     };
     // ... rest of payload
   };

In the TradeAnalysisModal component, update the header to display the IPS name:

tsx   // Current (broken):
   <div>IPS Criteria Analysis (Unknown IPS)</div>
   
   // Fixed:
   <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
     <span className="font-semibold">IPS:</span>
     <span>{analysisData.ips.name}</span>
     {analysisData.ips.description && (
       <TooltipProvider>
         <Tooltip>
           <TooltipTrigger>
             <Info className="h-4 w-4 text-muted-foreground" />
           </TooltipTrigger>
           <TooltipContent>
             <p className="max-w-xs">{analysisData.ips.description}</p>
             <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground mt-1">
               Alignment: {analysisData.ips.alignPct}% | Score: {analysisData.ips.scorePct}%
             </p>
           </TooltipContent>
         </Tooltip>
       </TooltipProvider>
     )}
   </div>
Verification Steps
After making these changes:

Ensure the API response includes ips.name and ips.description
Check that the modal header shows "IPS: 7DTE - 14DTE PCS Strategy" (or whatever IPS is active)
Verify the tooltip shows the description when hovering over the info icon

If the ips_id is Missing from Trades
If your trade data doesn't currently store an ips_id, you'll need to:

Add an ips_id column to your trades table (or prospective_trades table)
Update your trade creation logic to store which IPS was used for scoring
For existing trades, you might need to infer the IPS from the ips_score_calculations table by joining on trade_id

Let me know if you need help with the SQL schema changes or if the issue is elsewhere in the data flow.

# Trade Snapshot System - Fix Summary (Oct 14, 2025)

## Problem
Your `trade_snapshots` table was completely empty (0 rows) despite having a comprehensive snapshot system built and Vercel cron jobs configured.

## Root Cause
**Missing `CRON_SECRET` environment variable**

Your Vercel cron jobs were calling `/api/jobs/snapshot-sync` (POST endpoint) which requires authentication:
```typescript
// POST endpoint requires this header:
Authorization: Bearer ${process.env.CRON_SECRET}

// But CRON_SECRET was undefined
// Result: All cron requests returned 401 Unauthorized
```

## The Fix

### 1. Added CRON_SECRET to .env
```bash
# Added to .env (lines 60-62)
CRON_SECRET=tenxiv_snapshot_cron_2025_secure_key_v1
```

### 2. For Production (Vercel)
When you deploy to Vercel, add this environment variable:
1. Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add: `CRON_SECRET` = `tenxiv_snapshot_cron_2025_secure_key_v1`
3. Scope: Production, Preview, Development

## Verification

### Successful Manual Test (Oct 14, 2025 @ 3:17 AM)
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:3000/api/jobs/snapshot-sync
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Manual snapshot completed",
  "snapshots_captured": 18,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T03:17:36.195Z"
}
```

### Database Confirmation
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_snapshots,
       COUNT(DISTINCT trade_id) as trades_with_snapshots,
       MIN(snapshot_time) as earliest,
       MAX(snapshot_time) as latest
FROM trade_snapshots;

-- Result:
-- total_snapshots: 18
-- trades_with_snapshots: 18
-- earliest: 2025-10-14 03:16:37
-- latest: 2025-10-14 03:17:36
```

### Sample Snapshot Data
```sql
SELECT trade_id, snapshot_time, current_stock_price,
       unrealized_pnl, unrealized_pnl_percent,
       delta_spread, days_to_expiration
FROM trade_snapshots
ORDER BY snapshot_time DESC
LIMIT 3;

-- All 18 active trades now have initial snapshots with:
-- ✅ Stock prices
-- ✅ Spread prices
-- ✅ Greeks (delta, theta, vega)
-- ✅ P&L metrics
-- ✅ IV data
-- ✅ Risk metrics
```

## What Happens Next

### Automated Snapshots
Your Vercel cron jobs will now run on schedule:
- **2:30 PM EST** Mon-Fri → Capture mid-market snapshots
- **6:00 PM EST** Mon-Fri → Capture EOD snapshots + generate market context
- **9:00 PM EST** Mon-Fri → Capture after-hours snapshots

### Expected Volume
- **Per trade**: 3 snapshots/day
- **Total daily**: 18 trades × 3 = 54 snapshots/day
- **Weekly**: 54 × 5 = 270 snapshots/week
- **Monthly**: 54 × 21 = 1,134 snapshots/month

### What This Enables

#### 1. Behavioral Metrics (Auto-calculated from snapshots)
- `peak_pnl` - Highest unrealized P&L during trade
- `peak_pnl_date` - When peak occurred
- `days_at_profit` - Days with positive P&L
- `max_drawdown` - Largest loss during trade

#### 2. Pattern Detection (After 50+ snapshots)
- "Trades that hit 50% profit on day 3 tend to reverse"
- "High delta spreads (>0.40) signal increased risk"
- "Trades opened when IV rank >70 close profitably 78% of time"

#### 3. RAG Learning
- Snapshots converted to vector embeddings
- AI finds similar historical trade patterns
- Agent learns from past trade behaviors
- Better future trade recommendations

#### 4. Risk Monitoring
- Real-time alerts when delta exceeds thresholds
- Profit target notifications (>50% P&L)
- Loss alerts (<-50% P&L)
- Automatic pattern recognition

## Documentation

Complete setup and troubleshooting guide:
- [docs/SNAPSHOT_SYSTEM_SETUP.md](docs/SNAPSHOT_SYSTEM_SETUP.md)

Includes:
- Architecture overview
- File structure
- Manual triggering instructions
- Monitoring queries
- Common issues & solutions
- Cost analysis
- Integration with RAG/Pattern Detection

## Status Summary

✅ **Fixed Issues:**
- CRON_SECRET added to `.env`
- Snapshot service verified working (18 snapshots captured)
- Database schema confirmed correct
- Manual testing successful
- Documentation created

⏳ **Next Automated Run:**
- Tomorrow (Oct 14, 2025) @ 2:30 PM EST
- Expected: 18 new snapshots (one per active trade)
- Monitor Vercel logs for confirmation

🎯 **Your Tasks:**
1. Deploy to Vercel with `CRON_SECRET` environment variable
2. Verify first automated cron run (check Vercel logs)
3. Monitor snapshot accumulation over 1 week
4. Enable pattern detection once 50+ snapshots accumulated

## Other Findings

### Reddit Sentiment (Needs Review)
Per your earlier comment: "Reddit sentiment is important but I don't think we're calling it in correctly or using it correctly"

Current state:
- Table: `reddit_sentiment` - 86 rows, mostly zeros
- Not integrated with snapshot system
- Separate investigation needed

This is a separate issue from the snapshot system and can be addressed independently.
